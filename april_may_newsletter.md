The next meeting of the Central Riccarton Residents' Association Inc [CRRA] will be a forum on WEDNESDAY 18 APRIL beginning at 7pm in the Korean Yolin Church building on the corner of Clarence and Nelson Streets -- an opportunity for residents to express their opinions on matters they think affect our area and allow for discussion with our elected representatives to the City Council, Councillors Jimmy Chen and Helen Broughton. 

There are important issues to discuss:

The proposed 7.4% Council Rates Increase -- has your salary or wages increased by seven and a half per cent in the last year?!! Council CEO Tony Marryatt says he is "very comfortable" with the recommended rate increase!! What about the insurance shortfall?  Does Christchurch really need another grandiose stadium that is hardly ever used and maybe only filled once a year? How often has the revamped stadium at Addington beeen used since it opened? If the rugby union want a giant stadium, should they not pay for it? Some people on council and in council have shown themselves to be very good at coming up with schemes to spend other peoples' money. What do you think? Meanwhile the Riccarton Community Centre is in limbo while "council decide" what to do with it. This building, the only publicly owned building for hire in Riccarton, should be repaired promptly and made available for residentsâ€™ use. It was very well used by groups in the community before September 10, 2010. The council's draft annual plan is open for discussion - all residents should be interested in this. Add your ideas to the views of other residents so a submission can be presented on our behalf. On top of this ECAN are proposing to charge a rate increase of more than 10 per cent! 

The presence of a neighbourhood policing team in Riccarton -- has this made a real difference to you? Do you feel a lot safer as a result? On the matter of vandalism and disorder, it is important that residents report instances of these to the police. Southern Area Commander Johnston has told us that police should be called on 111 if you see acts of vandalism in our parks or around buildings or groups of people smashing glass bottles on footpaths or in driveways. Make a positive difference to our community and report these offences. Don't leave it to others to do.

A new dawn of co-operation between the University of Canterbury and the Riccarton community -- there has been a seismic shift in the attitude of the university to anti-social behaviour by students enrolled at the university living in Riccarton. Anti-social "students" are being told in writing that they must conduct themselves in a manner which does not bring the university into disrepute or there will be real consequences. The university has responded very quickly to instances of grossly anti-social behaviour at properties in Elizabeth Street and Blenheim Road and CRRA has contacted the owners of these properties as well as one in Broadbent Street where behaviour was clearly unacceptable.
